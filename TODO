- Fix indentation algorithm to parse correctly:
  `try..of..catch..after..end'
  (see http://github.com/jimenezrick/vimerl/issues/7)
- Review indent file from branch experimental-indent-aszlig.
- Document what info is taken from `rebar.config' (on syntax check and
  omni completion) and that Vim should be started from the project root
  dir, where src/, ebin/ and include/ are visible.
- Option for disabling omnicompletion cache (just prevent insert in the
  cache).
- Revise all the doc.
