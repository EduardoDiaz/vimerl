- Fix indentation algorithm to parse correctly:
  `try..of..catch..after..end'.
- Review indent file from branch experimental-indent-aszlig.
- Document what info is taken from `rebar.config' and that Vim should be
  started from the project root dir, where src/, ebin/ and include/ are
  visible.
- Don't compile modules for omni completion, let the user compile its
  project and then, Vimerl will use the .beam files.
- Option for disabling omnicompletion cache (just prevent insert in the
  cache).
